# KnuxLib

Working on decoupling KnuxLib from HedgeLib and Marathon by manually taking HedgeLib's ExtendedBinaryReader and transplanting bits of Marathon's into it to suit my needs. I'm also focusing on making KnuxTools a bit less bloated.

This README will be updated properly when things are fully ported over from the current master branch.
